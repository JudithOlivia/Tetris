What is this game: Its a Tetris game made from HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Why I made this game: TBH, my school blocked all game websites so I just made one so that I can play it in school.


Problem: The Js code was not working right: the blocks were messed up
Solution: I rewrote the code and fixed it
